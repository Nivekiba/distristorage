- automatic placement of virtual disks over the storage arrays

- io latency as primary metric for modeling and workload characterization

- output: proposal of optimal migration of data for load balancing

====> workload characterization
- io sizes, r/w ratio (using vmware esx which allow it in a light-weight and transparent), outgoing i/o requests, percentage of randomness
- this helps to see which and how io latency varies based on these factors in order to define a notion of "load"

====> load balancing engine

after a periodic time:
- get the device with maximum load and the one with minimum load
- recommend data migration between the 2 in order to balance load them
- avoid ping-pong of data
- avoid migration violating reliability or data protection policies

- propose these recommended migrations to admin user
- or automatically perform them at period of low activity 

*initial placement
- choose disk with minimum value of normalized load for a new virtual disk creation

====> evaluation

3 modules:
- admin: in charge of colleciton io stats and further apply migrations recommended by the analyser]
- modeler: create models for both workload and device
- analyser: take the generated models and generate migration recommendations
